# jude
A new toy programming language with some interesting features.

Now Jude is capable of sorting an array (bubble-sort, merge-sort, quick-sort. See the sample codes in /samples). So I believe Jude is now generally a practical compiler to use and I would like its source code to be visible from everyone.

Of course Jude is far from versatile and industrial, it will be improved step by step.
