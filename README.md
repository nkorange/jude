# jude
A new toy programming language with some interesting features.

Now Jude is capable of sorting an array (bubble-sort, merge-sort, quick-sort. See the sample codes in /samples). So I believe Jude is now generally a practical compiler to use and I would like its source code to be visible from everyone.

Of course Jude is far from versatile and industrial. It will be improved step by step and currently does not support the following features:

* float, pointer and reference type,
* user defined type including String, Enum, Structure, Class etc.,
* overload of procedure,
* and many other senior functionalities(IO, Network, Thread and so on).
